# Employee Directory
Uses Random User API and React to model an employee directory UI that shows all users (including pictures, location, and contact info) and lists users according to selected location. 

## Installation:
This project requires React, Axios, and React-Router-Dom. 

## Usage:
Use this app as a starting point to see how one might create an employee directory with actual employee information. The location sorting is just one example of how employees might be filtered and displayed according to specified criteria. 

## Contributing:
This project is open to contributions.

## To Do:
* Iterate over user cards similar to iteration over locations.
* Add cards to location to also display employee picture, etc. similar to All Employees page.
* Add more filtering options for other data (e.g. filter by title, department, etc.) given provided data.
* Add flags per country to make page more visually appealing.
